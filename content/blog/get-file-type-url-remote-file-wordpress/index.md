If you want to get the file mime type for a remote file and you have its URL, the function below can be used.

## Example

If the remote file is a png image with a url of `http://example.com/directory/image.png?ver=123`, passing in that URL to this function would return `image/png`.

`gist:46018fa445c2ceab7d0283fab4858de2`
