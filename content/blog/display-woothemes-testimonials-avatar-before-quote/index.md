By default, the WooThemes Testimonials WordPress plugin displays the quote, then the avatar (authorâ€™s image), then the attribution (name, title and url). You can use the following filter to display the avatar before the quote:

`gist:47742af303b4329fadf5`

You can also change the order of the attribution in relation to the avatar and quote using this same filter.
